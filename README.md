## 🔧 Core Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Run Tracking Log** | Tracking log of distance, pace, route, time, and calories. |
| **Solo and Group Modes** | Run alone or contribute to **Cumulative Goals** (e.g. "Team Abtrace runs to London" - 400km together) |
| **Live Leaderboards** | Ranks participants by total distance, improvement, consistency, etc. |
| **Progress Heatmaps** | Visualise when and how often you run — can be shared with others. |
| **Goal Setting** | Personal goals with progress tracking:<br>  - Daily, weekly, or event-based<br>  - Optional nudges or reminders |
| **Custom Groups** | Private groups for clubs, companies, families, or friends — invite-only with shared stats. |

## 🧩 Differentiators

| Feature | Why It Stands Out |
|---------|-------------------|
| Group-first design | Built around the *shared journey*, not just individual logging. |
| Friendly, not intense | No judgment-based gamification — celebrates consistency. |
| Visual UX | Emphasis on story-style recaps, heatmaps, and simple shareable graphics. |

---

## 📣 Growth Strategy

- **Partner with running clubs** and wellness communities.
- **Create a community leaderboard by region** — “Top Running Teams in Dublin”.
- **TikTok + IG ads** showing story-like “Day 12 of 21” journeys.

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Considerations

- **Privacy and location sensitivity**: Must allow for private mode and hide routes.
- **Low retention risk** after group milestones: Retention tools like streaks, unlockable content, and visual progress needed.

---

## 🚀 Future Expansion

- **Walking mode** for inclusive participation across all fitness levels.
- **Team vs Team competitions** for workplaces, schools, or cities.
- **Virtual races** with real-time map tracking.
- **Social accountability layer**: Let people pledge runs to charity or unlock rewards for consistency.
- **API + leaderboard widget** for embedding group stats into websites or Slack.
